### [DOWNLOAD (MAC ONLY)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/njbizzle/SellersClimateModel/main/NateMurphyASTR65_Final.dmg)
1. Click download link above
2. Navigate to the file in your downloads folder (called NateMurphyASTR65_Final.dmg)
3. Double click to open the DMG, a window with an app called **ASTR65_Final** will show up
4. **Right click ASTR65_Final and press open**, don't just double click to open
5. When the pop up shows up click "Open" (If you still don't see the "Open" option read the bottom)
6. The window should show up in 5-15 seconds (it takes some time)

If step 4 didn't open the application try dragging **ASTR65_Final** to your Desktop or Downloads and then repeating the right click open process.

### Uninstalling
1. Close out of the climate simulation
2. Nagivate to the window that opened in step 3
3. Right click on a blank section of the window and select "Eject ..."
4. Delete the original file NateMurphyASTR65_Final.dmg from your downloads folder


If after following step 4 and 5 in the installation instructions you still don't see the "Open" option, it's possible that you're running a more recent version of MacOS that doesn't allow unverified software. There's no way. The way around this is more complicated, I'd recommend just watching the video. 

However you can get around this by opening the terminal and running the command ```xattr -cr [path to the ASTR65_Final]```. This is easier if you drag and drop the ASTR65_Final app out of the dmg to a known location.
